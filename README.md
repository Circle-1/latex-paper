# LaTeX paper for Stock-X

This repo consists of LaTeX file, pictures to make the research paper. The format we used is the IEEE Conference Paper template provided by IEEE and Overleaf. For more info, refer [here](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/ieee-official).

This repo doesn't provide the PDF file of the paper (not yet), so if you want the output, compile the LaTeX file named `Conference.tex` present within the `latex` folder.
